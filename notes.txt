            Build and Development Tools

            When you run npm start or npm build, tools like Webpack, Babel, and ESLint (which live inside node_modules) compile your React code to a format that browsers can understand.
            These tools optimize your app, enable JSX support, and ensure smooth execution.
            React's Core Functionality

            Even though React is a frontend framework, it relies on node_modules to work.
            If you delete node_modules, your app won't even start because the core React library will be missing.
